#### Conclusion:

In this project, we conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a large dataset of Amazon products and discounts for the year 2023. The dataset was initially messy, containing missing values, incorrect data types, and various anomalies. Through a systematic data cleaning process, we successfully prepared the data for analysis, ensuring its quality and reliability.

Our analysis revealed several key insights and findings:

**Top Manufacturers and Categories**: We identified the top manufacturers on Amazon, with "PC" and "Puma" leading the way. In terms of product categories, "accessories" had the highest number of products, followed by "women's clothing" and "tv audio & cameras."

**Top Rated Brands and Categories**: We found that "Nike" and "Puma" were the top-rated brands on Amazon, each receiving over 300 5-star ratings. Among categories, "accessories" received the most 5-star ratings, indicating high customer satisfaction.

**Total Number of Ratings**: "Tv audio & camera" and "toys & baby products" categories received the most ratings from customers, suggesting a high level of interest and engagement in these product categories.

**Discount Analysis**: We analyzed discounts across various categories and sub-categories. "Women's clothing" had the highest average discount percentage, followed by "accessories." On the other hand, "home kitchen pets" and "grocery & gourmet foods" had the lowest average discount percentages, possibly due to the nature of these products.


In conclusion, this EDA project has provided valuable insights into Amazon's product offerings and customer interactions in 2023. The cleaned and analyzed dataset can serve as a foundation for further in-depth analyses, such as price forecasting, customer segmentation, and recommendation systems, to help businesses make data-driven decisions and enhance their competitiveness on the Amazon platform. The findings also highlight the importance of understanding customer preferences and optimizing pricing strategies in the highly competitive e-commerce market.
